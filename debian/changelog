beanstalkd (1.4.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - disable binlog-sizelimit.sh (expected binlog sizes were calculated
      assuming i386 arch), binlog-diskfull-delete.sh & binlog-diskfull.sh
      (test-scripts fail to start beanstalkd in alpha and ia64 arches; disable
      until I get access to reproduce the error)
  * make-tests-more-robust-and-tidy.diff:
    - minor changes to improve debug-ability (do not suppress potential error
      messages upon beanstalkd startup; echo beanstalkd invocation command)

    - revise package description to clarify that beanstalkd is a workqueue
      service, which is a specific case of messaging
