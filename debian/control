Description: simple, in-memory workqueue server
 Beanstalk is a simple, fast workqueue server. Its interface is generic, but
 was originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in high-volume
 web applications by running time-consuming tasks asynchronously.
 .
 This package has only the server.
