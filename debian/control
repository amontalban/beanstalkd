Description: simple, in-memory, workqueue service
 Beanstalkd is a simple, fast, workqueue service (a specific case of message
 queueing), in which messages are organised in "tubes". Beanstalk clients can
 insert and consume messages into and from such tubes.
 .
 The beanstalk interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing
 the latency of page views in high-volume web applications by running
 time-consuming tasks asynchronously.
 .
 Beanstalkd is meant to be ran in a trusted network, as it has no
 authorisation/authentication mechanisms.
 .
 This package has the server files.
